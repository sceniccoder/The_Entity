## Project Description
Tinderror is a revolutionary dating app that matches developers based on their programming errors and coding style. Where bugs become features and syntax errors lead to love connections! It's the only dating platform where your stack overflow searches and infinite loops are actually attractive qualities.

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Traditional dating apps focus on superficial qualities like looks, interests, and personality. But what about the REAL compatibility factors? Do they both write spaghetti code? Do they prefer tabs or spaces? Are they both victims of the infamous "works on my machine" syndrome? These are the questions that TRULY matter for developer relationships!

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Tinderror analyzes your code submissions, detects your unique programming errors, and matches you with developers who create complementary bugs! Our advanced algorithm considers factors like:
- How many semicolons you forget
- Your relationship with null pointer exceptions  
- Whether you're a console.log() debugger or a proper debugger user
- Your git commit message creativity level
- How often you copy-paste from Stack Overflow
